Question 1
Let’s suppose we want to write a query to answer both of these questions:
- How many items have been purchased?
- How many items do we have?

[ ] Category
    item_count
[x] Item_count
    Items_ever_purchased_count
[ ] Item_count
    User_count
[ ] User_count
    Item_id
    View_count

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 2
Please select all tables that will be necessary answer both of these questions:

- How many items have been purchased?
- How many items do we have?

[ ] View_items
[ ] Users
[x] Items
[x] Orders
[ ] Events

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 3
We’ve decided to only use the items and orders tables to answer the following questions:

- How many items have been purchased?
- How many items do we have?
Can we compute the columns Items_count, items_ever_purchased_count without a subquery?

[x] Yes
[ ] No

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 4
We’ve decided to answer the following questions:

- How many items have been purchased?
- How many items do we have?
Which of the following queries will answer both those questions without further computation?

[ ] SELECT 
        COUNT(DISTINCT items.id)       AS items_count,
        COUNT(DISTINCT orders.item_id) AS items_ever_purchased_count
    FROM  
        dsv1069.items
    JOIN
        dsv1069.orders
    ON 
        items.id = orders.item

[x] SELECT 
        COUNT(DISTINCT items.id)       AS items_count,
        COUNT(DISTINCT orders.item_id) AS items_ever_purchased_count
    FROM  
        dsv1069.items
    LEFT OUTER JOIN
        dsv1069.orders
    ON 
    items.id = orders.item

[ ] SELECT 
        COUNT(items.id)                AS items_count,
        COUNT(orders.item_id)          AS items_ever_purchased_count
    FROM  
        dsv1069.items
    JOIN
        dsv1069.orders
    ON 
        items.id = orders.item
    GROUP BY 
        items.id

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 5
In the previous question we decided that the query below could answer the questions :

- How many items have been purchased?
- How many items do we have?

--------------------------------------

SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT items.id)       AS items_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT orders.item_id) AS items_ever_purchased_count
FROM  
    dsv1069.items
LEFT OUTER JOIN
    dsv1069.orders
ON 
items.id = orders.item

--------------------------------------

Is this the only possible way to answer the question? Justify your answer.

"No, there are other ways."
