Question 1
Which of the following attributes distinguish a work-in-progress from a “polished” final query? (Select all that apply.)

[x] Every column has a descriptive name
[ ] Every column is listed in a GROUP BY clause
[x] The query is formatted consistently, or according to a style guide
[ ] Every join is an inner join

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 2
In which of the following sections did we perform analysis to directly guide decision making?

[x] Answering a question about reordering items
[ ] Pulling email addresses and item_ids for a promo email
[ ] Creating a view items table

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 3
Which of the following are uses of a dates rollup table?

[x] Creating dashboards with a complete set of dates
[x] Efficiently computing aggregates over a rolling time period
[ ] For keeping track of your meeting schedule

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 4
We’ve decided to only use the items and users tables to answer the following questions:
- How many items have been purchased?
- How many items do we have?
Which join type and order will allow us to correctly compute the columns Item_count, items_ever_purchased_count?

[ ] SELECT *
    FROM
      dsv1069.users
    JOIN
      dsv1069.orders
    ON 
      items.id = orders.item


[ ] SELECT *
    FROM
      dsv1069.orders
    LEFT JOIN
      dsv1069.items
    ON 
      items.id = orders.item

[ x SELECT   *
    FROM  
      dsv1069.items
    LEFT OUTER JOIN
      dsv1069.orders
    ON 
      items.id = orders.item

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 5
For this statement, fill in the __ with the appropriate inequality (<, <=, =, >=, >):
In any subset of the orders table:
Number of line items __ Number of distinct items ordered

[ ] >
[ ] =
[ ] <
[ ] <=
[x] >=

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6
Select the best definition of a windowing function?

[ ] It allows you to compute aggregations with a rolling date period.
[x] It is a function that computes a value on a certain partition, or window, of the data that is specified in the PARTITION BY statement.
[ ] It allows you to make your own windows of data. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 7

[x] How many items have been viewed?
[ ] How many users have purchased an item?
[ ] How many items do we have?
[x] How many items have been viewed but not ordered?
[ ] What work would need to be done to remove products from the catalog?
[x] How many items have been purchased?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 8
Which of the following tasks can be accomplished with a windowing function? (Select all that apply.)

[ ] Find the email address of each user
[ ] Find the price of each item
[x] Find the most recently viewed item
[x] Find the most expensive item per order

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 9
Let’s suppose we want to write a query to answer both of these questions:
-How many users have made a purchase?

Please choose the best set of columns for a final query that would answer these questions:

[ ] Item_count
    user_count
    order count

[ ] Category

[x] user_count
    users_with_purchases

[ ] User_count
    view_count
    order_count

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
