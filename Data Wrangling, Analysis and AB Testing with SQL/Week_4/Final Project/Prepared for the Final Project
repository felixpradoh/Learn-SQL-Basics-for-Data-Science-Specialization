[x] The item id
[ ] The item category
[ ] The user_id
[x] A test name or number
[x] The assignment (treatment or control?)

Question 4
In the final project weâ€™ll be doing AB testing at an item level. Check out the table final_assignment_qa. What other pieces of data will you need to compute the 30-day order binary. (Select all that apply).
Please note: 30-day order binary means show a 1 if the item was ordered at any point the 30 day period after treatment, and 0 if the item was never ordered.

[ ] The user_id
[ ] The item category
[x] I'm still missing something
[ ] The users table
[x] The orders table

Question 5
Use this AB testing calculator. Enter the numbers seen in the image, and use the results to determine if the results are statistically significant. Are the results statistically significant?

[x] No
[ ] Yes

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6
Use this AB testing calculator. Enter the numbers seen in the image, and select all the correct interpretations of the data. 

[x] We have not collected enough samples to be able to detect statistically significant lift of 1%
[ ] The treatment caused a 1% lift in the success metric
[ ] The treatment caused a lift of as much as 27% in the success metric
[x] There is no detectable change in this metric

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
