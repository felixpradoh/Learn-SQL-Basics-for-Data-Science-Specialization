Question 1
Which of the following are true when it comes to the business value of big data? (Select all that apply.)

[x] The size of the data businesses collect is growing
[x] Businesses are increasingly making data-driven decisions
[ ] Automated technologies mean that data scientists and data analysts are no longer needed

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 2
Spark uses...

(Select all that apply.)

[ ] our database technology (e.g., Postgres or SQL Server) to run Spark queries
[x] A distributed cluster of networked computers made of a driver node and many executor nodes
[ ] One very large computer that is able to run computation against large database
[ ] A distributed cluster of networked computers made of many driver nodes and many executor nodes
[x] A driver node to distribute work across a number of executor nodes

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 3
How does Spark execute code backed by DataFrames? (Select all that apply.)

[ ] It executes code determined in advance
[x] It optimizes your query by figuring out the best "how" to execute what you want
[x] It separates the "logical plan" of what you want to accomplish from the "physical plan" of how to do it so it can optimize the query 
[ ] It iterates over all of the source data to exhaustively evaluate queries

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 4
What are the properties of Spark DataFrames? (Select all that apply.)

[x] Resilient: Fault-tolerant
[x] Dataset: Collection of partitioned data
[x] Distributed: Computed across multiple nodes
[ ] Tables: Operates as any table in SQL environments

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 5
What is the difference between Spark and database technologies? (Select all that apply.)

[ ] Spark in an alternative to traditional databases
[ ] Spark operates for both data storage and computation
[x] Spark is a highly optimized compute engine and is not a database
[ ] Spark does not interact with databases but uses its proprietary DataFrame technology instead
[x] Spark is a computation engine and is not for data storage

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6
What is Amdahl's law of scalability? (Select all that apply.)

[ ] A formula that gives the expected speed of a single processor performing a computation
[ ] A formula that gives the theoretical speedup as a function of the size of a partition (or subset) of data
[ ] A formula that gives the number of processors (or other unit of parallelism) needed to complete a task
[x] A formula that gives the theoretical speedup as a function of the percentage of a computation that can be parallelized
[x] Amdahl's law states that the speedup of a task is a function of how much of that task can be parallelized

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 7
Spark offers a unified approach to analytics. What does this include? (Select all that apply.)

[ ] Spark unifies databases with optimized computation allowing for faster computation against the data it stores
[x] Spark allows analysts, data scientists, and data engineers to all use the same core technology
[x] Spark is able to connect to data where it lives in any number of sources, unifying the components of a data application
[x] Spark unifies applications such as SQL queries, streaming, and machine learning
[x] Spark code can be written in the following languages: SQL, Scala, Java, Python, and R

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 8
What is a Databricks notebook?

[ ] A cluster that executes Spark code
[ ] A single Spark query
[ ] A Spark instance that executes queries
[x] A collaborative, interactive workspace that allows you to execute Spark queries at scale

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 9
How can you get data into Databricks? (Select all that apply.)

[x] By uploading it through the user interface
[x] By registering the data as a table
[ ] By connecting to Dropbox or Google Drive
[x] By "mounting" data backed by cloud storage

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 10
What are the qualities of big data? (Select all that apply.)

[x] Velocity: the speed of data
[x] Variety: the diversity of data
[x] Veracity: the reliability of data
[ ] Valorous: the positives impact of data
[x] Volume: the amount of data
