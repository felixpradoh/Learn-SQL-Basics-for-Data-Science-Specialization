# Milestone 4: Presenting Your Findings (Storytelling)

*I have decided to use the Capstone Project Jupyter notebook saved as a .pdf for the presentation. This presentation is aimed at amateur data scientists, that want to learn and share their findings with me, or someone that just wants to check some general statistics in this dataset.*

*The main reason why I have chosen this format is that in this way, the audience can check and verify the python SQL code directly.*

*The hypothesis, findings, and insights from the SportsStats have been explained in the notebook accompanied by its corresponding visualizations.*

*I have followed and organized based on the Milestones proposed by the Course Capstone.*
