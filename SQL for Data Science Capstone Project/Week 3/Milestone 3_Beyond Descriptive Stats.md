# Milestone 3: Beyond DEscriptive Stats 

**Dive Deeper**

Look deeper into the features you are investigating, consider:

- Relationships / Correlation, Pearson Correlation
- Linear Regression for future prediction (if the relationship is linear)
- Textual Analysis for TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency; Row-based and  column-based, stop-word removal?

Specify 1-2 correlations you discovered. List the fields that you found to be correlated and describe what you learned from these correlations.

**Go Broader**

- Expand the features you are investigating. Look for connections/relationships that you may have initially missed.

- What jumps out at you now?

- Use the descriptive stats to point you to features that you may now want to consider- .

- What key terms did you discover in any text analysis, for whom? Any themes? If you are not analyzing text, summarize what other things you are considering in your analysis?

**New Metric**

Create 1 or 2 new metrics to track relationships of data you discovered. Explain why you created them.
